# Agenda app: A simple agenda application

Built to be my first project interacting directly with git/github.

Agenda app is a simple application made with Python programming language, along side with Customtkinter GUI framework and SQLite as the main database.

## App features:

- Create and edit appointments.
- Set a reminder for each appointment.
- Log every important event.
- Save, export and backup data in different formats.
- Create and switch between multiple user profiles.
